# ideation-and-planning-framework

## Description
A [gradio]([url](https://www.gradio.app/)) + [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) python app for Ideation and Planning.

## Installation
Set up a virtual env and install requirements.
For now the app assumes you have your `$OPENAI_API_KEY` defined locally. 

```sh
python -m venv .venv && . ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Just run the main python file and open the gradio app in your favorite browser.
```sh
python ideation_and_planning_framework.py
```

## Features
This is in progress.  I'll start with one ideation framework and add more.
